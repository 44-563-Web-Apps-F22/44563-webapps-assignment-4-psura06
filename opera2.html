            <p class="speech Princess">I like your spirit, girls!  We have to meet
                Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
                Wear naught but what is necessary to
                Preserve your dignity before their eyes,
                And give your limbs full play.</p>

            <h6 class="name">Blanche</h6>
            <p class="speech Blanche">One moment, ma'am,
                Here is a paradox we should not pass
                Without inquiry.  We are prone to say
                "This thing is Needful — that, Superfluous"—
                Yet they invariably co-exist!
                We find the Needful comprehended in
                The circle of the grand Superfluous,
                Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
                Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful.
                These singular considerations are—</p>
            <h6 class="name">Princess</h6>
            <p class="speech Princess">Superfluous, yet not Needful — so you see
                The terms may independently exist.</p>
            <p class="direction">(To Ladies) </p>
            <h6 class="name">Princess</h6>
            <p class="speech Princess">Women of Adamant, we have to show
                That women, educated to the task,
                Can meet Man, face to face, on his own ground,
                And beat him there.  Now, let us set to work;
                Where is our lady surgeon?</p>
